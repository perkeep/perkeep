Generationer is an optional interface and an optimization and paranoia
facility for clients which can be implemented by Storage
implementations.

If the client sees the same random string in multiple upload sessions,
it assumes that the blobserver still has all the same blobs, and also
it's the same server.  This mechanism is not fundamental to
Perkeep's operation: the client could also check each blob before
uploading, or enumerate all blobs from the server too.  This is purely
an optimization so clients can mix this value into their "is this file
uploaded?" local cache keys.
