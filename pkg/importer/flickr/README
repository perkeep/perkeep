Flickr Importer
===============

This is an incomplete Camlistore importer for Flickr.com. So far it can import
the first 100 photos from a photostream and also their set metadata.

To use:

1) Fill out http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/noncommercial/ to get a
   Flickr API key and secret.
2) Start the server with the flag -flickrapikey=<apikey>:<secret>
3) Navigate to http://<server>/importer-flickr/login
4) Watch import progress on the command line
