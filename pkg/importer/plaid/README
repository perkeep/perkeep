Plaid Importer
==============

Plaid (plaid.com) is a service that allows users to connect to financial
institutions (namely credit card providers) and retrieve financial
transactions in a uniform format.

To use:

1) Sign up for a Plaid developer account: https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup
2) Start the devcam server with plaidapikey flag:
   $ devcam server -plaidapikey=<client_id>:<secret>
3) Navigate to http://<server>/importer/plaid and click "Add new account"
4) Enter username and password for your financial institution's account, and
   select the institution type (eg, Amex). (Unfortunately, OAuth is not
   available)
5) Watch your transactions roll on in
