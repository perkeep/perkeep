<p>Perkeep (<a href="https://github.com/perkeep/perkeep/issues/981">née Camlistore</a>) is a set of open source formats, protocols, and software for modeling, storing, searching, sharing and synchronizing data in the post-PC era. Data may be files or objects, tweets or 5TB videos, and you can access it via a phone, browser or FUSE filesystem.</p>

<p>Perkeep is under active development. If you're a programmer or fairly technical, you can probably get it up and running and get some utility out of it. Many bits and pieces are actively being developed, so be prepared for bugs and unfinished features.</p>

<p>Things Perkeep believes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your data is entirely under your control</li>
  <li>Open Source</li>
  <li>Paranoid about privacy, everything private by default</li>
  <li>No SPOF: don't rely on any single party (including yourself)</li>
  <li>Your data should be alive in 80 years, especially if you are</li>
</ul>
