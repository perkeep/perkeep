<h1>Principles</h1>

<p><b>TODO:</b> elaborate.  This is just a quick sketch.</p>

<ul>
<li>Disk is cheap and getting cheaper</li>
<li>Put the user in control.  Own your data.</li>
<li>Privacy and paranoia</li>
<li>Decentralization is important, but..</li>
<li>End users won't be dorks.  Must also be possible to be easy, hosted.</li>
<li>Content-Addressability has so many awesome properties (validation, cachability, etc).  Use it as much as possible.</li>

<li>Redundancy and over-explicitness is fine.  Compression will help.
Redundancy and over-explicitness will be convenient for future digital
archeologists, too.</li>

</ul>
