Camlistore contributors regularly use Linux and OS X, and both are
100% supported.

Developing on Windows is sometimes broken, but should work.  Let us
know if we broke something, or we accidentally depend on some
Unix-specific build tool somewhere.

See http://camlistore.org/docs/contributing for information on how to
contribute to the project and submit patches.  Notably, we use Gerrit
for code review.  Our Gerrit instance is at https://camlistore.org/r/

See architecture docs: https://camlistore.org/docs/

You can view docs for Camlistore packages with local godoc, or
godoc.org.

It's recommended you use git to fetch the source code, rather than
hack from a Camlistore release's zip file:

$ git clone https://camlistore.googlesource.com/camlistore

(We use github for distribution and collaboration with some people,
but the Gerrit git server & code review system is the main repo. See
http://camlistore.org/docs/contributing for how to use them.)

On Debian/Ubuntu, some deps to get started:

$ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 pkg-config git

During development, rather than use the main binaries ("camput",
"camget", "camtool", "cammount", etc) directly, we instead use a
wrapper (devcam) that automatically configure the environment to use
the test server & test environment.

To build devcam:

$ go run make.go

And devcam will be in <camroot>/bin/devcam.  You'll probably want to
symlink it into your $PATH.

Alternatively, if your Camlistore root is checked out at
$GOPATH/src/camlistore.org (optional, but natural for Go users), you
can just:

$ go install ./dev/devcam

The subcommands of devcam start the server or run camput/camget/etc:

$ devcam server      # main server
$ devcam appengine   # App Engine version of the server
$ devcam put         # camput
$ devcam get         # camget

Some old wrapper scripts haven't been converted yet to be part of
devcam.  For now, they're at:

$ ./dev-camtool
$ ./dev-cammount
... etc.

Once the dev server is running,

  - Upload a file:
      devcam put file ~/camlistore/COPYING
  - Create a permanode:
      devcam put permanode
  - Use the UI: http://localhost:3179/ui/

Please update this file as appropriate.
