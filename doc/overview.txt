Camlistore: Content-Addressable Multi-Layer, Indexed Store
============================================================================

This file contains old design notes.  They're correct in spirit, but shouldn't
be considered authorative.

See http://camlistore.org/docs/


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Design goals:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* Content storage & indexing & backup system
* No master node
* Anything can sync any which way, in any directed graph (cycles or not)
  (phone -> personal server <-> home machine <-> amazon <-> google, etc)
* No sync state or races on arguments of latest versions
* Future-proof
* Very obvious/intuitive schema (easy to recover in the future, even
  if all docs/notes about Camlistore are lost, or the recoverer in
  five decades after I die doesn't even know that Camlistore was being
  used....) should be easy for future digital archaeologists to grok.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Design assumptions:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* disk is cheap and getting cheaper
* bandwidth is high and getting faster
* plentiful CPU & compression will fix size & redundancy of metadata

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Layer 1:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* content-addressable blobs only
  - no notion of "files", filenames, dates, streams, encryption,
    permissions, metadata.
* immutable
* only operations:
  - store(digest, bytes)
  - check(digest) => bool (have it or not)
  - get(digest) => bytes
  - list([start_digest]) => [(digest[, size]), ...]+
* amenable to implementation on ordinary filesystems (e.g. ext3, vfat,
  ntfs) or on Amazon S3, BigTable, AppEngine Datastore, Azure, Hadoop
  HDFS, etc.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Schema of files/objects in Layer 1:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* Let's start by describing the storage of files that aren't self-describing,
  e.g. "some-notes.txt" (as opposed to a jpg file from a camera that might
  likely contain EXIF data, addressed later...).  This file, for reference,
  is in doc/json-signing/example/some-notes.txt

* The bytes of file "some-notes.txt" are stored as-is in one blob,
  addressed as "sha1-8ba9e53cbc83c1be3835b94a3690c3b03de0b522".
  (note the explicit naming of the hash function as part of the name,
  for upgradability later, and so all parties involved know how to
  verify it...)

* The filename, stat(2) metadata (modtime, ctime, permissions, etc) now
  also need to be stored.  The key design point here is that file
  metdata is ALSO just a blob, content-addressed.  The blob is a JSON
  file (for human readability, compactness).  XML and Protocol Buffers
  were both also considered, but the former is too redundant, bloaty,
  tree-ish (overkill) and out of vogue, while Protocol Buffers don't
  stand up to the human readable future digital archaeologist test,
  and they're also not self-describing with the proto schema declared
  in-line.

  This file would thus be represented by a JSON file, as seen in
  docs/json-signing/example/some-notes.txt.camli, and addressed as
  "sha1-7e7960756b39cd7da614e7edbcf1fa7d696eb660", its sha1sum. This identifier
  can be used in directory listings, etc. Note that camli files do not have any
  magical filename, as they're not typically stored with their filename. (they
  are in the doc/json-signing/examples/ directory just to separate them out, but
  that's a rare case.) Instead, a camli JSON object is known as such if the
  bytes of the file begin exactly with the bytes:

        {"camliVersion"

  ... which lets upper layers know what it is, and how to index it.

  See the doc/schema/ directory for details on Camli JSON objects and their
  schema.

* Note that camli files can represent:

  -- files
  -- directories
  -- trees/snapshots (git-style)
  -- tags on other objects
  -- stars/ratings on other objects
  -- deletion claims/requests (since everything is immutable, you can
     only request a deletion, and wait/hope for GC later...)
  -- signed statements/claims on other objects
     (think decentralized commenting/starring on the web,
      verifying claims with webfinger lookups to find
      public keys to verify signatures)
  -- references to encrypted/split files
  -- etc... (extensible over time)

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Syncing
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-- nodes can push/pull between storage layers without thought.  No
   chance of overwriting stuff.

-- the assumption is that users control and trust and secure all their
   storage nodes: e.g. your phone, your home server, your internet
   server, your Amazon S3 node, your App Engine appid / datastore
   instance, etc.

-- users configure which nodes push/pull to which other nodes, forming
   their own sync topology.  For instance, your phone may not need a
   full copy of all content you've ever saved/produced... its primary
   goal in life is probably to quickly push out any unique content it
   produces (e.g. photos) to another machine for backup.  And maybe
   cache other recently-accessed content locally, but not worry about
   it being destroyed when you drop and break your phone.

-- no encryption is assumed at the Camli storage layer, though you may
   run a Camli storage node on an encrypted filesystem or blockdevice.

Indexing Layer
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* scans/mapreduces over all blobs, provides higher-level APIs to list
  objects, list directories, see snapshots of trees at points in time,
  traverse graphs of objects (reverse indexing e.g. tags/stars/claims
  object<->object)

* ... TODO: document

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Mid layer
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* It'll often be the case that a client (e.g. your phone) knows about
  a file (e.g. a photo) and has its metadata, but doesn't have its raw
  JPEG blob bytes, which might be several MB, and slow to transfer
  over a wireless connection.  Camli storage nodes may also declare
  their support for helper APIs for when the client knows/assumes the
  type of a given blob.

  In addition to the operations in layer 1 above, you could also assume
  most Camli storage nodes would support any API such as:

     getThumbnail(blobName, [ ... sizeParams .. ]) -> JPEG thumbnail

  .. which would make mobile content browsers lives easier.
