The /camli/<blobref> endpoint returns a blob the server knows about.

A request with the GET verb will return 200 and the blob contents if
present, 404 if not. A request with the HEAD verb will return 200 and
the blob meta data (i.e., content-length), or 404 if the blob is not
present.

The response must include an explicit Content-Length, even with HTTP/1.1.
(The one piece of metadata a blobserver keeps on a blob is its length,
 which is used in both enumerate-blobs bodies and responses to blob GETs.)
