<h1>Release 0.5 ("Castletownbere")</h1>

<p><b>2013-09-21</b></p>

<p>Another month, another Camlistore release. After our <a
href="0.4">0.4 release</a>, we're happy to release 0.5, codename "<a
href="https://maps.google.com/?q=Castletownbere,+Ireland">Castletownbere</a>".
I'm currently in Castletownbere celebrating my grandmother's 80th
birthday with a bunch of extended family.  While I haven't done much
hacking in the past few days, we've all had a pretty productive month,
busy working on new features and fixing bugs.</p>
