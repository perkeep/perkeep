There are two TODO lists. This file (good for airplanes) and the online bug tracker:

     https://code.google.com/p/camlistore/issues/list

Offline list:

-- "filestogether" handler, putting related blobs (e.g. files)
   next to each other in bigger blobs / separate files, and recording
   offsets of small blobs into bigger ones

-- ditch blob.SeekFetcher vs StreamingFetcher distinction. just
   make Fetcher (be streaming). any seekers can slurp, now that
   blobs are defined to be bounded (16 MB).

-- diskpacked doesn't seem to sync its index quickly enough.
   A new blob receieved + process exit + read in a new process
   doesn't find that blob. kv bug? Seems to need an explicit Close.
   This feels broken. Add tests & debug.

-- websocket upload protocol. different write & read on same socket,
   as opposed to HTTP, to have multiple chunks in flight.

-- extension to blobserver upload protocol to minimize fsyncs: maybe a
   client can say "no rush" on a bunch of data blobs first (which
   still don't get acked back over websocket until they've been
   fsynced), and then when the client uploads the schema/vivivy blob,
   that websocket message won't have the "no rush" flag, calling the
   optional blobserver.Storage method to fsync (in the case of
   diskpacked/localdisk) and getting all the "uploaded" messages back
   for the data chunks that were written-but-not-synced.

-- benchmark uploading a 100MB file to localdisk & diskpacked
   from camput.

-- measure FUSE operations, latency, round-trips, performance.
   see next item:

-- ... we probaby need a "describe all chunks in file" HTTP handler.
   then FUSE (when it sees sequential access) can say "what's the
   list of all chunks in this file?" and then fetch them all at once.
   see next item:

-- ... HTTP handler to get multiple blobs at once. multi-download
   in multipart/mime body. we have this for stat and upload, but
   not download.

-- ... if we do blob fetching over websocket too, then we can support
   cancellation of blob requests.  Then we can combine the previous
   two items: FUSE client can ask the server, over websockets, for a
   list of all chunks, and to also start streaming them all.  assume a
   high-latency (but acceptable bandwidth) link. the chunks are
   already in flight, but some might be redundant. once the client figures
   out some might be redundant, it can issue "stop send" messages over
   that websocket connection to prevent dups. this should work on
   both "files" and "bytes" types.

-- cacher: configurable policy on max cache size. clean oldest
   things (consider mtime+atime) to get back under max cache size.
   maybe prefer keeping small things (metadata blobs) too,
   and only delete large data chunks.

-- UI: video, at least thumbnailing (use external program,
   like VLC or whatever nautilus uses?)

-- rename server.ImageHandler to ThumbnailRequest or something? It's
   not really a Handler in the normal sense. It's not built once and
   called repeatedly; it's built for every ServeHTTP request.

-- unexport more stuff from pkg/server. Cache, etc.

-- look into garbage from openpgp signing

-- make leveldb memdb's iterator struct only 8 bytes, pointing to a recycled
   object, and just nil out that pointer at EOF.

-- bring in the google glog package to third_party and use it in
   places that want selective logging (e.g. pkg/index/receive.go)

-- (Mostly done) verify all ReceiveBlob calls and see which should be
   blobserver.Receive instead, or ReceiveNoHash.  git grep -E
   "\.ReceiveBlob\(" And maybe ReceiveNoHash should go away and be
   replaced with a "ReceiveString" method which combines the
   blobref-from-string and ReceiveNoHash at once.

-- union storage target. sharder can be thought of a specialization
   of union. sharder already unions, but has a hard-coded policy
   of where to put new blobs. union could a library (used by sharder)
   with a pluggable policy on that.

-- support for running cammount under camlistored. especially for OS X,
   where the lifetime of the background daemon will be the same as the
   user's login session.

-- website: remove the "Installation" heading for /cmd/*, since
   they're misleading and people should use "go run make.go" in the
   general case.

-- website: add godoc for /server/camlistored (also without a "go get"
   line)

-- tests for all cmd/* stuff, perhaps as part of some integration
   tests.

-- move most of camput into a library, not a package main.

-- server cron support: full syncs, camput file backups, integrity
   checks.

-- status in top right of UI: sync, crons. (in-progress, un-acked
   problems)

-- finish metadata compaction on the encryption blobserver.Storage wrapper.

-- get security review on encryption wrapper. (agl?)

-- peer-to-peer server and blobserver target to store encrypted blobs
   on stranger's hardrives.  server will be open source so groups of
   friends/family can run their own for small circles, or some company
   could run a huge instance.  spray encrypted backup chunks across
   friends' machines, and have central server(s) present challenges to
   the replicas to have them verify what they have and how big, and
   also occasionally say what the SHA-1("challenge" + blob-data) is.

-- sharing: make camget work with permanode sets too, not just
   "directory" and "file" things.

-- sharing: when hitting e.g. http://myserver/share/sha1-xxxxx, if
   a web browser and not a smart client (Accept header? User-Agent?)
   then redirect or render a cutesy gallery or file browser instead,
   still with machine-readable data for slurping.

-- rethink the directory schema so it can a) represent directories
   with millions of files (without making a >1MB or >16MB schema blob),
   probably forming a tree, similar to files. but rather than rolling checksum,
   just split lexically when nodes get too big.

-- delete mostly-obsolete camsigd.  see big TODO in camsigd.go.

-- we used to be able live-edit js/css files in server/camlistored/ui when
   running under the App Engine dev_appserver.py.  That's now broken with my
   latest efforts to revive it.  The place to start looking is:
        server/camlistored/ui/fileembed_appengine.go

-- should a "share" claim be not a claim but its own permanode, so it
   can be rescinded?  right now you can't really unshare a "haveref"
   claim.  or rather, TODO: verify we support "delete" claims to
   delete any claim, and verify the share system and indexer all
   support it.  I think the indexer might, but not the share system.
   Also TODO: "camput delete" or "rescind" subcommand.
   Also TODO: document share claims in doc/schema/ and on website.

-- make the -transitive flag for "camput share -transitive" be a tri-state:
   unset, true, false, and unset should then mean default to true for "file"
   and "directory" schema blobs, and "false" for other things.

-- index: static directory recursive sizes: search: ask to see biggest directories?

-- index: index dates in filenames ("yyyy-mm-dd-Foo-Trip", "yyyy-mm blah", etc).

-- get webdav server working again, for mounting on Windows.  This worked before Go 1
   but bitrot when we moved pkg/fs to use the rsc/fuse.

-- work on runsit more, so I can start using this more often.  runsit should
   be able to reload itself, and also watch for binaries changing and restart
   when binaries change.  (or symlinks to binaries)

-- add gofmt check to "make presubmit". also add "make fmt" target.

-- BUG: osutil paths.go on OS X: should use Library everywhere instead of mix of
   Library and ~/.camlistore?

OLD:

-- add CROS support? Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * + w/ OPTIONS
   http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/cross-site-xmlhttprequest-with-cors/

-- brackup integration, perhaps sans GPG? (requires Perl client?)

-- blobserver: clean up channel-closing consistency in blobserver interface
   (most close, one doesn't.  all should probably close)
